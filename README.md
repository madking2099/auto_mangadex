# auto_mangadex

A tool for downloading manga from MangaDex with a focus on automation and ease of use.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```plaintext
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```plaintext
# Example environment variables for auto_mangadex
MAX_RETRIES=3
HTTP_TIMEOUT=10
MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=2
PDF_PAGE_SIZE=letter
PDF_CREATION_TIMEOUT=60
ENCRYPTION_KEY=  # This will be automatically generated if not set or if set to empty or whitespace
MANGADEX_BASE_URL=https://api.mangadex.org/
CACHE_TTL=300
MAX_RESPONSE_TIME=10.0
IMAGE_QUALITY=data
RATE_LIMIT_CALLS=2
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
DB_NAME=mangadex_data
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=default_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=./downloads  # Directory where downloads will be saved
```

Note: If ENCRYPTION_KEY is not set, empty, or contains only whitespace, it will be automatically generated by the application.


## Database Setup:
    Ensure you have the appropriate database setup based on DATABASE_TYPE. 
    For SQLite, no additional setup is needed; the database file will be created in the same directory.

**Notes:**
- I've added a section under "Environment Variables" to explain `ENCRYPTION_KEY` behavior.
- Included `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` in the environment variables section with a note on its usage for customization.
- Updated the "Usage" and "Customization" sections to reflect these changes.
- Make sure to replace `[Your License here, e.g., MIT, GPL, etc.]` with the actual license information for your project.

These updates will help users understand how to set up and customize their environment for using `auto

### Project

This is a series of Python files that interact with each other and the public MangaDex API.

The goal of this set of files and project is to be a docker-ized web-application that can executed via CLI as well.

Each file will contain 1 or more class objects that can be imported modularly without conflicting function and class names.

The possible result may even be something that can be container-ized.
