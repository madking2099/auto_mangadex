# auto_mangadex

This is a series of Python files that interact with each other and the public MangaDex API.

The goal of this set of files and project is to be a docker-ized web-application that can executed via CLI as well.

This will be separated into 7 files. 

Each file will contain 1 or more class objects that can be imported modularly without conflicting function and class names.

The possible result may even be something that can be container-ized.
