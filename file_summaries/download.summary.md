download.py contents.py:

Classes:

    Config:
        Manages configuration settings from environment variables, ensuring default values are set if variables are not present.
    CustomBar:
        Custom progress bar class for visual feedback during processing.
    PDFIntegrityError:
        Custom exception for handling PDF integrity issues.
    AsyncProgress:
        Provides asynchronous progress reporting for operations.
    ImageDownloader:
        Main class handling the download of images, conversion to PNG, and creation of PDFs asynchronously.


Methods of ImageDownloader:

    init:
        Initializes the downloader with an output path, a callback for progress updates, and sets up cancellation support.
    cancel_processing:
        Sets the cancellation event to allow stopping ongoing processes.
    _update_progress:
        Updates progress if a callback function is provided.
    _check_image_quality_async:
        Asynchronously checks if an image meets quality criteria (size and integrity).
    _download_image_async:
        Asynchronously downloads images with retry logic and error handling.
    process_batch_async:
        Processes multiple manga chapters in batch mode with retry mechanisms for failures.
    _process_batch_once_async:
        Handles the processing of one batch, including image downloading, conversion, and PDF creation.
    _create_pdf_with_retry_async:
        Attempts to create a PDF with retries if initial attempts fail, including timeout handling.
    _convert_to_png:
        Converts an image to PNG format.
    _create_pdf:
        Creates a PDF document from a list of images with added metadata.
    _add_pdf_metadata:
        Adds metadata to the PDF file based on manga data.
    _check_pdf_integrity:
        Checks if the PDF file is intact by verifying its header and trailer.
    _check_pdf_header:
        Verifies the presence of the correct PDF header.
    _check_pdf_trailer:
        Checks for the PDF trailer to confirm file integrity.


Other Functions:

    signal_handler:
        Handles interrupt signals for graceful shutdown.
    shutdown_async:
        Ensures all asynchronous tasks are cancelled and wait for completion before shutdown.


This structure provides a comprehensive solution for downloading manga images, converting them, and compiling them into PDFs with error handling, retry mechanisms, and asynchronous operations for improved performance.
