Class:

    DataStorage: 
        Manages storage, retrieval, and manipulation of application data across various database types (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) with advanced features like connection pooling, migrations, data archiving, purging, audit logging, etc.


Functions:

    init: 
        Initializes the DataStorage instance, setting up connection pooling, database initialization, and indexes.
    _setup_connection_pool: 
        Sets up a connection pool based on the database type specified in environment variables.
    _get_connection: 
        Retrieves a database connection from the pool.
    _return_connection: 
        Returns a connection to the pool for reuse.
    _execute_query: 
        Executes SQL queries with error handling, logging, and connection management.
    _initialize_database: 
        Creates necessary tables in the database for storing various types of data, including versioning and archiving.
    _create_indexes: 
        Creates indexes on columns for performance optimization.
    apply_migrations: 
        Applies SQL migrations from .sql files to update the database schema.
    get_db_version: 
        Retrieves the current version of the database schema.
    set_db_version: 
        Sets the version of the database schema.
    export_schema: 
        Exports the database schema to a .sql file.
    archive_manga: 
        Moves manga data from the active table to an archive table.
    purge_deleted_manga: 
        Deletes manga records that have been marked as deleted for a specified period.
    _log_action: 
        Logs actions for audit purposes.
    store_manga: 
        Stores manga data with normalization for authors, artists, and tags, including concurrency control.
    get_manga: 
        Retrieves manga data from the database, utilizing a cache for improved performance.
    check_data_consistency: 
        Performs checks to ensure data integrity across tables, looking for orphaned entries or inconsistencies.
    monitor_performance: 
        Logs basic performance metrics of the database and cache usage.
    get_manga_count: 
        Returns the count of manga entries in the database.
    enhance_security: 
        Applies security enhancements like row-level security (for PostgreSQL) and provides notes on security for other database types.
    del: 
        Ensures that database connections are properly closed when the object is destroyed.
    health_check: 
        Performs a basic check to ensure the database connection is functional.


These functions collectively provide a robust interface for managing data in a database, ensuring data integrity, security, performance, and scalability within the constraints of the initial application design.
